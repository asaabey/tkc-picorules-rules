    The last uACR was {{ picoformat('tg4410.uacr1') }} mg/mmol and the one before was {{ picoformat('tg4410.uacr2') }} mg/mmol. <br />  
    {% if tg4410.iq_tier == 3 %}Serum Albumin and Cholesterol have been checked {% if tg4410.low_alb %} and there is hypoalbuminaemia{% endif %}{% if tg4410.high_chol %} and hypercholesterolaemia{% endif %}. {% endif %}
    This is consistent with a primary nephrotic syndrome.
